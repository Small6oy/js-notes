# Data types
JavaScript has several data types, which can be broadly classified into two categories: primitive data types and reference data types.

### Primitive data types: 

These are the simplest data types in JavaScript, and include:

`Number`: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point values.
`String`: Represents sequences of characters, used for text data.
`Boolean`: Represents true or false values.
`Symbol`: A unique and immutable data type that can be used as an object property key.
`undefined`: Represents the absence of a value.
`null`: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

### Reference data types: 

These are more complex data types that refer to a memory location, and include:

`Object`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, and can be used to model more complex data structures.
`Array`: A special type of object that can be used to store a collection of values.
`Function`: Represents a block of code that can be executed.
`BigInt`: Represents integers larger than JavaScript's Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER.
It's important to note that JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that variables do not have a fixed data type and can hold values of different types at different times.

## Memory Impact
JavaScript has several data types, each of which has its own characteristics and impact on memory usage:

### Primitive data types: 

These include number, string, boolean, symbol, and undefined. They are simple and take up a fixed amount of memory. Numbers are either stored as 64-bit floating-point values or as a special value called NaN (Not-a-Number) when the value is not a number. Strings are stored as a sequence of Unicode characters, and booleans take up one byte of memory. Symbols are a new feature in ECMAScript 6 and are unique and immutable, they are also stored in a symbol registry.

### Reference data types: 

These include object, array, function, and null. They are more complex than primitive data types and take up more memory. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, and their memory usage depends on the number of properties and their values. Arrays are also objects and their memory usage depends on the number of elements and their values. Functions are also objects and their memory usage depends on the amount of code in the function.

BigInt: It's a new feature in ECMAScript 2020, it's a way to represent integers larger than JavaScript's Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER.

It's important to note that JavaScript uses a dynamic memory allocation system, which means that memory is allocated as needed and automatically freed when it's no longer needed. This is known as garbage collection and it's done by the JavaScript engine.

In general, it's important to keep in mind that JavaScript is a high-level language, and the memory management details are abstracted away from the developer. However, it's a good idea to be mindful of the data types you use and the amount of data you're working with to avoid performance issues.
